# M02 Workshop: Build the Distributed Apps of the Future Using Dapr
09/26/2022 8:00am - 5:00pm
Level: Intermediate to Advanced

Building distributed application is hard… As developers, we want to focus on delivering business value with new features but there are so much things to also take care of on the side, especially in a distributed environment. Things as pub/sub, state management, bindings & triggers, service discovery, distributed tracing etc. Dapr tries to solve this problem by providing all of this to you so you can mix and match what pieces you want to use and also pick between many implementations of for example state management like cosmosDB, redis or dynamoDB.

In this workshop, you'll get hands on experience in building your own microservice based application using Dapr. You'll learn the following features of Dapr:

State management
Service discovery
Publish / Subscribe
Distributed Tracing

We'll be building the application using ASP.NET Core, C#, Docker & Kubernetes.
Basic knowledge of Docker & Kubernetes is advised to get the most out of this workshop.

You will learn:

Making life of cloud developers easier
Learn about what Dapr can do for you as a developer
Make distributed applications easier

## Dapr Fundamentals GloboTicket Demo Application
